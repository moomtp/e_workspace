Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the IT Support Engineer position at TSMC Arizona. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from National Central University and experience working as a Software Engineer. I am interested in joining your Assistance Center team to support users and production systems.

In my past experience, I have helped set up and manage systems using Linux, iptables(DNS), PHP, and Apache. I also have experience in writing automation scripts with Python and using Node.js for backend development. I enjoy solving problems, improving system processes, and learning new technologies. I have also worked with CI/CD pipelines(Jenkins, k8s,...etc) and know how to make systems more stable and efficient.

I am excited about the chance to work at TSMC, where I can use my IT skills to help support world-leading chip production. I like working in a challenge environment and believe automation can make a big difference in support quality and speed.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to talk more about what I can bring to your team at TSMC Arizona.

Sincerely,
Ginwei Chen
