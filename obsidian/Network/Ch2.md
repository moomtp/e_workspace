### 2A
Features of ethernet : unreliable, connectionless
- Reliable connection vs. Unreliable connection
ACKs/NACKs vs. doesn't send ACKs

##### Topology
1. Bus topology
all nodes in same collision domain(can collide each other)
2. 

### 2D

switch is different from hub, which has many network card for handling muti network access

Therefore, switch can handle collusions in local network

Auto negotiations : once the cable plug-in,  switch and computer will check network speed

when Each packet entering switch, switch will check where they need to go

SCM(switch control module) will handing package transfer

ALE : a module which storages destination address table

### 2E

##### Frame format
one package should contain : 

- preamble : allow the receiver sync with the signal
- DA : destination address
- SA : source address
- type : the data type(ie : ipx, ip protoal)
- FCS : frame check seq (CRC32), check if package has bit error

ethernet is non reliable. Not like reliable commutication protoal like ack, nck

max size of package 1518 byte
min size of package(LLC + PAD) is 64 byte

The address belongs to the adaptor , not the host

each adaptor has it's unique address, usually has 6 * 8bits

each ethernet device manufacturer has it's unique prefix to addess

unicast address v.s. boradcast
broadcast should transfer to every device, and it's DA will be all 1's

also if package want to tranfer into a specific group, only few numbers of DA will be set to 1's

### 2F
#### MAC protocal
any signal is broadcast over the entire network

#### CSMA (carrier sense multiple access)
main concept : listen before transmit
if channel sened busy, defer trrasmission
as a solution of collision

still has collision on cable
#### CSMA/CD(collision detection) : 
if collision detected(on sender), colliding transmissions aborted

### 2G

#### CSMA/CD

**Carrier sense** means that all nodes can disitigush each other

1-persistent protocal : listen on ethernet until bus go idle

if collition probability(p) = 1 , means the transmit must be collided

CSMA/CD is no centralized contorl, means it has high possible for line to collision

32-bit jamming seq : for broadcasting the transmits send which before has collition

a shortest stardand tarnsmit in CSMA/CD has 64-bit preamble + 32-bit jamming 

##### collision window 

1 round trip : 51.2 micro sec(walk throught the 500m line bus)

every ethernet frame must be at least 512 bits(64 bytes)long

14 bytes of header + 46 bytes of data + 4 bytes of CRC


### 2H

###### collition window
why 512 bits?
-> the length linited in 2500m
-> collision window = 1 round trip (2a)


10Mbps * 51.2* 10 ^-6 sec = 512bits

##### tramits should not be too long or too short
-> too long : other user can't send (512 bits)
-> too short : sender can't konw the transmit is collided or not(32 + 64 bits)

### 2I

###### binary exponetial backend algo.(BEBA)

how long the time between the sender resend the next transmit

waits a creatin amout of time and tries again

each time the adaptor tries to transmit but fails, it **doubles the amount of time it waits** before try again

the algo. randomly selects a k between 0 and 2^n -1

mostly 16 times collition sender won't send this tramits again -> means the loading on bus line is too busy

#### CSMA/CD protocol

- Carrier sense beafore tarnsmission
- Carrier sense while tarnsmission
- backoff : random delay after collision
- deference : defers trasmission if channel is sensed busy
- collision window (solt time) : In IEEE 802.3 is defined as 51.2 * 10^-6 sec

Collision signal is generated by physical layer

### 2J

##### the performance of the ehternet

under heavy loads, too much of the network's capacity is wated by collisions

optimal throuthput : means the loading should not be too light or too heavy

In nowdays, bus line ethernet is not usable because of the workload is limited

link layer : MAC protoal(CSMA/CD) and frame format
physical layer : cable(100BASE-TX), fiber(100BASE-SX, 100BASE- FX ... etc)

#### Summary : 
- MAC protocal -- CSMA/CD
- Connection less, unreliable transmission
- Topology from bus to star(switches)
- Half-duplex transmission in bus topology 
1. work best under lightly loaded conditions
2. too much collision under heavy load
- Full-duplex transmssion in switch topology (point to point)
1. no more collisions
2. excellent performance (wired speed)
